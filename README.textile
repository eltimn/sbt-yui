h2. Usage

Soon to be hosted on a repo, but until then, you can download this source and:

<pre>sbt publish-local</pre>

Check out the "Use the Plugin" section of the "SbtPlugins Howto":http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/wiki/SbtPlugins

instead of <pre> val a = ... </pre>  do <pre> val yuiCompressor = "hoffrocket" %% "sbt-yui" %% "0.1"</pre>

Mix in to your project definition:
<pre><code>
  class MyWebProject(info: ProjectInfo) extends DefaultWebProject(info) with hoffrocket.YuiCompressorPlugin ...
</code></pre>
